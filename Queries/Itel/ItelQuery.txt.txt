itel has launched the flagship S23 Plus smartphone recently, and it provides some of the most interesting and next-level features that make it unique in comparison to other smartphones. There is no doubt that the  itel''s  S23 Plus will be the best smartphone in its class because it comes with a Unisoc Tiger T616 (12nm) chipset and an Octa-core CPU (2 x 2.0 GHz Cortex-A75 + 6 x 1.8 GHz Cortex-A55), which delivers astonishing performance. On the other hand, the  itel S23 S23 Plus''s 8GB of RAM (+8GB of virtual RAM) with UFS 2.0 256GB internal memory boosts the game. There has not been a confirmation yet as to whether it will come with a dedicated memory card slot or not.
