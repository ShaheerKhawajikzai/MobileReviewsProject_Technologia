Smartphone manufacturer Vivo unveiled the new Y18 series, which will be available soon on the market, but today we are going to take a look at the amazing specifications of the  Vivo Y18''s. So let''s begin with the massive 6.56-inch display, which is a fully HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen that supports a high resolution of 720 x 1612 pixels. For those who want performance, the new Y18 will be a very good choice since it comes with a 2.0 GHz Octa Core CPU and a powerful Mediatek Helio G85 (12nm) chipset to smoothly handle a number of applications. In addition to that, the all-new  Vivo''s Y18 is expected to land with 6GB and 128GB of internal memory, as well as a dedicated memory card slot. Now let''s find something for photography enthusiasts in the new Y18. A set of 13 MP + 0.08 MP sensors will be located at the back, along with the bright LED flashlight, and a single 5 MP selfie shooter will be hidden under the small waterdrop notch. You have an enormous 5000mAh battery fitted in your new  Vivo Y18, which has the ability to last the entire day on just a single charge. Hence, Vivo has stepped back into the game with the Y18 in order to compete with other brands, and as a consequence, it seems that there will be tough competition between Samsung as well as major brands going forward after the launch of the Y18 by  Vivo.','\images\0531f9bb-16ad-4a0b-b7e1-17c38303c407.jpg', 'Coming Soon','53,999','Android 14 OS  ','Funtouch OS  ','N/A  ','N/A  ','Dual Sim, Dual Standby (Nano-SIM)  ','Various  ','SIM1: GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900
