Tech beast Huawei is gearing up for the P70, which will soon be hitting the local and global markets, with most of the recent leaks showing that it will be the ultimate beast phone by the brand. It has been quite some time since  Huawei has gotten back into the game, especially in Asian countries, which is why the all-new  Huawei P70 is expected to be a mind-blowing handset to get back into the game and grab position once again. It is now time to move on to the interesting and insane specifications that the new P70''s have to offer. First of all, you are going to have a massive and giantic 6.7-inch LTPO OLED capacitive touchscreen display to produce sharp colors with a higher resolution of 1220 x 2700 pixels and a buttery smooth refresh rate of 120 Hz. The display of this P70 is protected by one of the toughest layers, which is  Huawei Kunlun Glass. As we all know, smartphones are always very well known for their cameras and next-level photography, so with the new P70, you will have a triple rear camera setup with 50 MP + 13 MP + 12 MP sensors and a 16 MP selfie sensor on the front hidden under the small Panch hole. Delivering the beatable performance of the latest  Huawei P70 is the Huawei P70 chip and an Octa-core CPU. With the addition of 12GB of RAM, it can easily handle your multiple applications and tasks without any delays or errors. An enormous 5000 mAh battery is fitted inside the new  Huawei''s P70 to keep it active all day on just one charge. There is no confirmation that it will support the fast charge or not. In favor of other brands, including Samsung , I would say that they should prepare themselves to meet the Unstoppable P70 by Huawei.
