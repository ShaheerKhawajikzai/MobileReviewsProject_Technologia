 Nokia seems pretty mysterious about 7 Plus launch. We got our hands on some solid news that a new smartphone is going to reveal by the HMD Global Oy and it will be called Nokia 7 Plus. It seems that this device fits perfectly in the given scenario where on one side we have a mid-ranger and on the other side we have flagship device and specifications of Nokia''s 7 Plus are showing that it will be the bridge between these two corners with not too high nor less specs. In the GeekBench listing it is revealed that the  Nokia 7 Plus 7 Plus''s chipset will be made by the leading vendor Qualcomm and the model of the chipset will be Snapdragon 660 which is little better then the SD 630 that was used in the predecessor of  7 Plus by Nokia. We were expecting 6 GB of RAM but instead of our expectations we have got 4 GB of RAM that will be a perfect weapon against the messy multi-tasking of  Nokia Plus. In the past days Samsung was not too much famous as this brand was but now once again we will see that it will rise again as the star of the galaxy and  Nokia 7''s Plus is going to take one step closer to its victory. Internal storage seems to be same as we got in previous device which was 64 GB and it will be backed up the SD card that gonna use the  7 Plus''s second SIM slot.
