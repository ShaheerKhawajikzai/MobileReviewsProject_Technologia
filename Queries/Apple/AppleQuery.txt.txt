The wait is over! Apple has officially announced iPhone 6 Plus with a mighty 5.5 inch HD screen based on Retina display that is equally impressive. Apple has done it again but this time its an amazing phablet, yet another tight end contender for the 6 inch world.  Apple''s nailed it with 1080p LED backlit display that''s not only bigger than all the previous  iphones but much better in every aspect plus it has a much tougher glass protection. With its first 64-bit A8 chipset  Apple''s new smartphones are now much more powerful yet saving much more energy, enabling  6 plus to provide you with no less than 16 days of standby along with a a full day of continuous talk time. But one thing has still not changed,  6 plus still comes with a non removable battery. Packed with an 8.0 MP iSight Camera having large 1.5 micron pixels and f/2.2 aperture,  Apple''s new face detection and other technologies will be a plus for your photo sessions. The new slow mode is now much improved and your new  iphone can go up to 240 frames per second, amazing isn''t it?  Apple''s new phablet is an incredible device that comes in between the larger ipad and the smaller  iphone 6. Actual price is not yet revealed in Pakistan and we have to wait a bit to find that out specially if you are waiting to get your hands on  6 plus. Another interesting thing to note, Apple has discontinued the 32 GB versions and instead you''ll find only 64GB and 128GB versions of  6 plus. The new fablet have become very eminent and probably will get a vast popularity among users especially the lover of  iphones. But on par with the obvious advantages, The first thing that comes to mind is how to manage such a "shovel" with one hand?
