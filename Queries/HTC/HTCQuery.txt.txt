HTC unveiled the Desire 626G Plus, already out into the Indian market with a price tag of Rs 16,900. The Catchy name forced to recall another recently announced handset HTC Desire 526G+. And in fact, these two devices has a lot in common. Both have a gigabyte of RAM, both are built on the 1.7GHz Octa-core processor, though HTC did not specify exactly what kind of chipset both have but based on the leaked specification of Desire 626G+ it also includes support for LTE. It would be quite logical to assume that might be based on the same chipset. However, the difference is in the price and that too is quite noticeable. Capacity of the volatile memory of Desire 626G plus is 8 GB expandable. There are few other differences apart from the model number that also contributed to mark the difference in price and these are as the screens and cameras. Screen here is much better: IPS, 5 inches with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. + A 13 Megapixel main camera having a f/2.2 aperture, autofocus and flash plus a secondary 5-megapixel front camera. These two smartphones are also available in the European market but without the plus sign in the title i.e as HTC Desire 626G and Desire 526G. External similarity of names with a numeric difference naturally generates some confusion and will surely take some time for the users to get use to it. HTC 626G+ will be available to the users in pakistan in mid of this year and will be priced as a mid range handset.

HTC surprised us with the Desire 12S that landed out of nowhere and launched without any hint. Looking the renders of this phone it seems that this phone is following the lead of U12 Life that''s why HTC Desire 12S''s design is quite identical to that smartphone. Talk of the town is this that the camera placement on the backside of the phone is unorthodox and camera on backside of HTC Desire 12S is missing the center point and placed just away from the middle of the phone. Well as you can see camera is placed just in middle but Desire 12S''s LED flash is placed away from the center which is often happen in the most of the devices but here what seems to be a problem is this that both camera and the LED flash of HTC''s Desire 12S shares the same bump which is causing trouble and gives you feeling that back camera of this phone is placed away from the center. Just below the camera of Desire 12S by HTC you will get the fingerprint scanner so from now on it seems that camera will be moved to on the backside in the entry level devices just like what we saw in HTC Desire''s 12S. IPS LCD display is used in this device and bezels on the sides are reduced while on top and bottom bezels of this device is also fair for the given price range of HTC 12S. 5.7 inch display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 chip are the highlighted specifications of this new device where its 32 GB internal storage is enough to store data.
