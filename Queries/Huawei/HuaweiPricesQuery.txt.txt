Huawei with its new upcoming Y5 2019, may surprise everyone. Its Y6 Prime brand has already been launched in Pakistan and now this new upcoming handset will make its debut with less powerful specs.  Huawei Y5 2019 Y5 2019 has got a smaller screen size than its previous variant. With such type of low specs handsets, the company wants to capture the market at a lower level as well.  Huawei''s  Y5 2019 will come equipped with the following specifications. The device is fueled with the MediaTek MT6761 chipset while Y6 Prime as compared to  Huawei Y5 2019''s chipset, was packed with more powerful MediaTek Helio P22. So, the chipset suggests that the coming handset will be a low-end. But it does not mean that the chipset used in Y5 2019 by Huawei is a poor one. It is still considered one of the powerful chipsets. The system on chip is packed with 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of native storage. The microSD slot will enable the  Huawei 2019 to enhance the storage up to 256 gigabytes. Thus the storage with this microSD support will no longer be a problem. The screen will present you IPS LCD display along with full HD resolution. Huawei  Y5''s 2019 screen display will provide you a 19:9 aspect ratio. The phone will come with Android 9.0 pie. It will be packed with a single rear sensor of 13 megapixels while the front camera of the  Huawei Y5 2019 Y5 2019 is going to be 5 megapixels. The capacity of the battery is 3020 mAh That is considered a powerful for such low-end handset. Like it Y6 Prime variant,  Y5 2019''s not going to have any fingerprint reader. This is one of the weak points of the handset otherwise its a complete smartphone for a low budget customer. Now, it will be a great challenge for the Korean giant Samsung to produce high-quality handsets at a minimum price.','\images\81741082-3ac0-472c-965d-1de431b501c3.jpg', 'Discontinued','$0','Android 9.0 (Pie)  ','EMUI 9.0  ','147.1 x 70.8 x 8.5 mm  ','146 g  ','Dual Sim, Dual Standby (Micro-SIM)  ','Midnight Black, Modern Black, Sapphire Blue, Amber Brown  ','SIM1: GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900

Tech beast Huawei is gearing up for the P70, which will soon be hitting the local and global markets, with most of the recent leaks showing that it will be the ultimate beast phone by the brand. It has been quite some time since  Huawei has gotten back into the game, especially in Asian countries, which is why the all-new  Huawei P70 is expected to be a mind-blowing handset to get back into the game and grab position once again. It is now time to move on to the interesting and insane specifications that the new P70''s have to offer. First of all, you are going to have a massive and giantic 6.7-inch LTPO OLED capacitive touchscreen display to produce sharp colors with a higher resolution of 1220 x 2700 pixels and a buttery smooth refresh rate of 120 Hz. The display of this P70 is protected by one of the toughest layers, which is  Huawei Kunlun Glass. As we all know, smartphones are always very well known for their cameras and next-level photography, so with the new P70, you will have a triple rear camera setup with 50 MP + 13 MP + 12 MP sensors and a 16 MP selfie sensor on the front hidden under the small Panch hole. Delivering the beatable performance of the latest  Huawei P70 is the Huawei P70 chip and an Octa-core CPU. With the addition of 12GB of RAM, it can easily handle your multiple applications and tasks without any delays or errors. An enormous 5000 mAh battery is fitted inside the new  Huawei''s P70 to keep it active all day on just one charge. There is no confirmation that it will support the fast charge or not. In favor of other brands, including Samsung , I would say that they should prepare themselves to meet the Unstoppable P70 by Huawei.
