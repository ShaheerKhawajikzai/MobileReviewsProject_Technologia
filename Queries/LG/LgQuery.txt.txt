LG brought new phone named G7 Fit with a less powerful chipset which they have used in their last flagship due to the scarcity of the Qualcomm snapdragon 835 made by the Samsung. LG G7 Fit acquired Qualcomm''s Snapdragon 821 to begin its journey and it seems that other thing which is a possible cause for this chipset is this that they are trying to reduce the cost of LG''s G7 Fit and compensate its fans with a mind blowing phone which has power and stability too at the same time. Most of devices present in market are unbalanced but G7 Fit by LG is seems to be a balanced smartphone with moderate specifications and its prices is also equal to its specifications. Other thing which is missing in LG Fit is that this phone did not launching under the Android One program but user interface of this phone is modified by the company. Common thing between the LG G7''s Fit and other variant is this that both of devices have the same 32 GB of built-in storage while RAM of both devices is also same and it is 54 GB. External memory or SD card option is also available in LG G7 Fit which can expand the internal storage up to 512 GB. Thinking of going out with friends for a swimming then this phone has Water and dust proofing too. LG G7 Fit''s battery is 3000 mAh which is not acceptable amount for the device of this caliber so its a negative point for this Korean giant. One more important which about G7 Fit''s specs is this that this phone has Quick Charge 3.0 so I think you have got the idea that what I am talking about.
